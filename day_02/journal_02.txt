What logic was most confusing today?
Where did I feel flow?
Did my tools reflect mastery or mess?
How would a founder use these tools?


1. I was little confused with min to hours conv and multiplying with percentages. 
Also with the print format {minutes}
2. I felt the flow in the timer function also control flow in the tracker function
3. My tools reflect not absolute mastery still in the basics 
4. A founder may directly track his productivity juz by their hours spent and a timer function to deal 
with their focus mode
