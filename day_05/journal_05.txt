What did I build today that felt “real”?
What part of the system challenged me most?
Did I modularize properly or write spaghetti?
Would I be proud to show this to a hiring manager?

1. I built a daily tracker system where its functions felt like in real app
2. The most challenging part was the nested dictionaries creation and accessing it
3. Well not mostly i have modularized the code but not like spaghetti
4. No if i just modularized the code then i would have been proud
