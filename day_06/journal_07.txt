How did it feel to read back my own logs?
What pattern did I notice in my habits?
How will I use this insight to adjust my strategy?
What would it take to automate life improvement?

1. It felt like i have wasted more time juz sitting around not being proactive
2. I noticed my sleep cycle is not consistent
4. It would take a tracker app with each tasks tracking and daily logging makes it better
