How did dictionaries change my way of thinking today?
Did I build a tool I would personally use?
Can I imagine a bigger system that could evolve from this?

1. With dictionaries i can map and store data of any type.
also Unique keys
2. Yeah i built a contact manager where i can save and view and contacts safe without ambiguity
3. yeah of course the request responses in web pages uses JSON type which i learned to dump today.
the contact manager can be evolved into a real time system
