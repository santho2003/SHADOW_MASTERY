What did organizing the project teach me?
How did it change the way I think about code?
What would it take to make this a real product for public use?

1. Organizing makes to understand things better and the flow of working
2. It changed my way of thinking to write function, utils separtely so that they can modified easily
3. It would take real efforts for developers and also customized for public.
