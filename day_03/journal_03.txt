What did my code “understand” today?
How does this help me think like a founder?
What’s the most elegant solution I wrote?
What system could I automate using lists?

1. I understood the indexing using enumerate.
Using methods in lists. Matplot for bar chart
2. Log tasks and their completion status. Focus Analyzing system using graph visualization
3. Using methods(sum, min, max) and using emoji than creating a separate list for completed tasks
4. Using lists i could automate the focus and track daily tasks
